# Machine Learning Models Showcase

A comprehensive showcase of different machine learning models implemented using the Iris dataset. This project demonstrates various aspects of machine learning workflow, from data exploration to model evaluation.

## 🎯 Features

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Multiple ML model implementations:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Model evaluation and comparison
- Feature importance analysis
- Clear documentation and explanations

## 📋 Requirements

All required packages are listed in `requirements.txt`. Install them using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the requirements
3. Open `notebooks/ML_Models_Showcase.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
4. Run the cells to explore the analysis
